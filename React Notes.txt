	create a new folder(React)
	install vscode

	Now install react by using command - npx create-react-app myfirstapp
	After installing react, go to project folder by using command - cd myfirstapp
	now run server by using command - npm start

Components- we can create a group of elements in this component and apply css style to them , we can custiomize our components according to our device requirements
	Rules of component
		We can create n number of components 
		with the help of ffc keyword we can get snippet code to create component
		Component name always starts with Capital letter
		and content which we are returning should be in between div container 
		Anything out of div container written will throw error
		And for a module we can have only one export statement , that means only one function can be exported 
		Multiple components can be created with callback function return them in export function 
		Every component needs to be rendered in App.js file orelse it will not get executed , even page will be automatically loaded

What is Jsx
	jsx - Javascript xml 
	Before react we used to have separate files for html and js , where corresponding code were written in that file only. While react adds an advantage that we can write html elements in js also 
props 
	props-properties
	props are nothing but , communication between the prompts and sending data from one component to other component
	in this data will be sent from parent(sender) to child(reciver) , which happens in one way 
	and child component can just read that data
	Destructuring of props
		if props recives data like having key value pairs , then we have a syntax to Destruct it
				const {key1, key2, ...} = props.variable_name
				Here variable_name will be the name of which will be sending data from parent component
