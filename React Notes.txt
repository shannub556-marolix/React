Installation 
	create a new folder(React)
	install vscode
	install node - https://nodejs.org/en/download
	go to folder and open command utility centre from there 
	Now install react by using command - npx create-react-app myfirstapp
	After installing react, go to project folder by using command - cd myfirstapp
	now run server by using command - npm start

Components- we can create a group of elements in this component and apply css style to them , we can custiomize our components according to our device requirements
	Rules of component
		We can create n number of components 
		with the help of ffc keyword we can get snippet code to create component
		Component name always starts with Capital letter
		and content which we are returning should be in between div container 
		Anything out of div container written will throw error
		And for a module we can have only one export statement , that means only one function can be exported 
		Multiple components can be created with callback function return them in export function 
		Every component needs to be rendered in App.js file orelse it will not get executed , even page will be automatically loaded

What is Jsx
	jsx - Javascript xml 
	Before react we used to have separate files for html and js , where corresponding code were written in that file only. While react adds an advantage that we can write html elements in js also 
props 
	props-properties
	props are nothing but , communication between the prompts and sending data from one component to other component
	in this data will be sent from parent(sender) to child(reciver) , which happens in one way 
	and child component can just read that data
	Destructuring of props
		if props recives data like having key value pairs , then we have a syntax to Destruct it
				const {key1, key2, ...} = props.variable_name
				Here variable_name will be the name of which will be sending data from parent component

State 
	In react, states is a internal storage mechanism which is used by react components to store and update thier own data 
	State allows React components to manage and update their data dynamically, which enables them to respond to user interactions, changes in data, or other events
	useState
	with the help of useState hook we can update data
	useEffect 
	if there are multiple useState then it will go to infinite loop
	to overcome that , we use useEffect so that it will take care of that loops

Terinary Operator
	syntax : sample_condition? True : False 
	if sample_condition is true , True will execute orlse False will execute

NPM Manager 
	we can get packages from npm site by browsing our requirements and load it simply by following instructions mentioned in that browser

EeventListeners and Forms
	If any change is accourced we will call EeventListeners whereas we need peform after complete action is done then we will go with from

Arrays and objects
	we will store all data coming from api and access them according to requirement 

Template Literals
	we can return a variable along with statement
	for the statement we need to write it under backtics(``)
	let course = with shannu 
	syntax : {`Welcome to react ${course}`}
